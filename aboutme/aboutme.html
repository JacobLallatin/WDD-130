    <p>Hey everyone! I am from Puyallup Washington and this is my third semester here at BYUI. The degree that I am currently majoring in is Pyschology. 
        I recently started to get into
        computers which has is why I have taken an interest in this class. My hope is to gain a better understanding about how websites are made and the 
        thought process behind coding.
        Also, I enjoy reading, 
        playing some games and going out to eat. My favorite author of all time is Brandon Sanderson.
    </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church for my entire life. My family has always loved the gospel and that
        has been a great influence on my life. One of my favorite scriptures is Mosiah 2:17 as I believe greatly in the 
        power of service.
    </p>
    <p>Great to meet you all, see you in class! </p>
